Othello
==========

This repository shows old AngularJS application featuring the [Othello game (also known as Reversi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi), **refactored** using the [components introduced in AngularJS 1.5+](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component) the [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) module loader and the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language to make it better and also similar to the new Angular 2+ style.

This repository can be used as an example to whoever wants to **prepare** an old AngularJS (1.x) application to the new Angular 2+, but also for those who just want to improve its AngularJS source code **without** actually migrating to the new Angular 2+.

## Project history and goal

This application was initially our first experiment to learn AngularJS, started in December 2014.

In 2017 I decided to start refactoring it using the "*preparation steps*" suggested by the [Incrementally upgrade an old AngularJS application to Angular 2+ official tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/upgrade.html).

As the tutorial says, *these preparation steps are all about making the code more decoupled, more maintainable, and up to speed with modern development tools. That means **the preparation work will not only make the eventual upgrade easier, but will also generally improve our AngularJS applications**.*

In short: wheather you will one day migrate to the new Angular 2+ or just stay with AngularJS forever, those preparation steps just **make your AngularJS application better**.

The goal of this repository is to show step by step how to apply those preparation steps and making your AngularJS application better and similar to Angular 2+ without actually changing the underlying framework.
